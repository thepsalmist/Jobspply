The Norwegian Refugee Council has approximately 5000 committed and competent employees involved in projects across four continents. In addition, NRC runs one of the world’s largest standby rosters -NORCAP, with 650 professionals, ready to be deployed on 72 hours notice when a crisis occurs
",https://www.myjobmag.co.ke/jobs/accelerated-education-specialist-at-norwegian-refugee-council,"
The purpose of the Accelerated Education (AE) Specialist is to provide leadership to support inter-agency efforts to develop a harmonised approach to AE in Kenya. Out of the more than 210,000 refugees of school age in camps in Kenya, 46 per cent are out of school and 47 per cent of those who are in school are overage.
There are also large unknown numbers of youth in communities who want to learn but who cannot enrol or for whom the formal education system is not a good fit. There are a number of actors providing AE opportunities in camps.
While the programmes have been entitled differently and, in some cases, the target group and relationship to the national system has varied, the overall aim has been similar in delivering condensed content within a shorter time frame in a safe space for over-age and out of school children and youth.
In May 2019 NRC co-hosted with UNHCR an AE workshop in Kenya in collaboration with the Accelerated Education Working Group (AEWG).
The workshop recommended the formation of a national technical working group (as a subsidiary of the Education Sector Working Group) to strengthen coordination among stakeholders, and take work forward around four key areas:

(2) Curriculum development and associated materials;
(3) Teacher training; and (4) AE management training.
The role of the AE Specialist is to work collaboratively with the Ministry of Education (MoE), UNICEF, UNHCR and all education actors in Kenya towards a harmonised AE approach that is anchored in the national education system. This approach is intended to invest in the national education system, strengthening capacity in non-formal education in Kenya, for the benefit of refugee learners as well as Kenyan children and youth.
Additionally, the AE Specialist will provide technical support to NGOs AE programmes in Kenya in terms of technical development, strategic direction and quality assistance including mentoring, training and capacity building of staff on AE programme delivery.
