Data integrity review: To provide assurance that the database design and structure provides the best possible design for the organizational needs and corresponding application and future integration needs. The purpose is the scrutiny of live data to verify adequacy of controls and impact of weaknesses, as noticed from any of the above reviews.
Business continuity review: The review includes existence and maintenance of fault tolerant and redundant hardware, backup procedures and storage, and documented and tested disaster recovery/business continuity plan, effectiveness of disaster recovery plan, as well as ensuring existence of well-defined I.S Audit manual and its compliance thereon.
